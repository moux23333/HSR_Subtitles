1
00:00:03,316 --> 00:00:05,950
The other shore... is very cold.

2
00:00:11,416 --> 00:00:16,116
May I borrow your warmth... one last time?

3
00:00:19,766 --> 00:00:23,233
Thank you for fulfilling this wish of mine.

4
00:00:27,133 --> 00:00:31,466
The place I'll be going to is what humans call the land of sorrows.

5
00:00:34,566 --> 00:00:38,700
But with this heartbeat, and the residual heat of this embrace...

6
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:44,633
I shall turn the nether realm into a gentle place of rest.

7
00:00:59,533 --> 00:01:05,900
This embrace may be brief, but it's the proof that I once "lived."
