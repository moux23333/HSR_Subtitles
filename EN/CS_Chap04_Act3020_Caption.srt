00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:09,300
The sound of collapse and cries... They are sounds I'll never forget — the haunting echoes of the black tide.

00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:15,800
At that time, I cowered in the temple, waiting for {RUBY_B#Death}Thanatos{RUBY_E#} to lead me from my bitterness to their river.

00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:24,800
But... what arrived was a group of fugitives, guided by Oronyx, seeking an oracle from the Holy Maiden.

00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:34,800
O destiny, I scream at thee — To hell with the Holy Maiden! I am nothing but a blind woman now!

00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,800

00:00:54,700 --> 00:01:10,800
