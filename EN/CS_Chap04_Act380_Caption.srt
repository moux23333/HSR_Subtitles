00:00:02,133 --> 00:00:05,450
We must bring light to these dark times!

2
00:00:11,133 --> 00:00:12,349
With just a glimmer of light...

3
00:00:13,183 --> 00:00:14,633
I'll be able to pierce through the clouds...

4
00:00:15,533 --> 00:00:17,383
Use mine, Hyacine.

5
00:00:18,783 --> 00:00:19,350
I am...

6
00:00:19,966 --> 00:00:21,383
the one who bears the world—

7
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:23,750
I am...

8
00:00:24,633 --> 00:00:26,166
the blazing sun, destined

9
00:00:26,166 --> 00:00:26,783
to rise!
