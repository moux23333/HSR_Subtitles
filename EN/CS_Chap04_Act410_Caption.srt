00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:05,549
If there were a lie so brilliant that it could fool everyone...

2
00:00:06,933 --> 00:00:08,416
Wouldn't it simply become the truth?

00:00:09,866 --> 00:00:12,666
Lies will always be lies, Cifera...

4
00:00:14,133 --> 00:00:18,750
But sometimes... they can be more noble than the truth.
