1
00:00:00,375 --> 00:00:01,833
I don't want to die!

2
00:00:02,083 --> 00:00:03,208
Please, I'm begging you.

3
00:00:03,541 --> 00:00:04,666
Just let me go!

4
00:00:05,125 --> 00:00:06,041
I don't want to die, please.

5
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:08,791
I don't want mercy like this!

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,041
Just... let me go... I need them...I don't...

7
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,166
I hate these icy hands.

8
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:14,541
Get it over with.

9
00:01:14,958 --> 00:01:16,458
End its suffering.

10
00:01:33,291 --> 00:01:35,791
The Reaper has blessed your hands.

11
00:01:36,833 --> 00:01:39,333
Only you can grant them peace.

12
00:02:10,125 --> 00:02:11,833
Embrace death.

13
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:14,375
Walk alongside it.

14
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:23,541
Is that you... Castorice?

15
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,500
All of them... have gone,

16
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:36,250
heeding Death's summon,

17
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:40,041
crossing into their domain.

18
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:44,958
I...

19
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:47,041
must go too.

20
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,916
I don't fear it,

21
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,833
Just... I have some regrets.

22
00:04:57,125 --> 00:05:00,125
Watching people leave this world again and again...

23
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:03,041
it must be

24
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:04,666
lonely for you.

25
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:10,666
You must want to desperately embrace them

26
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:13,875
before they go.

27
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:18,833
I can't...

28
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:21,833
these hands...

29
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:23,083
they're too cold...

30
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,458
But big sister Castorice...

31
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:38,875
your hands are so warm.

32
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:42,625
Just like anyone else's.

33
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:46,000
So go on, don't hold back,

34
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:49,666
give me a warm hug.

35
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:53,041
Can hands like these...

36
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,166
really be warm?
