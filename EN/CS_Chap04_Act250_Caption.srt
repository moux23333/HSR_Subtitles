00:00:00,566 --> 00:00:03,500
My teacher, Anaxagoras,

2
00:00:05,099 --> 00:00:07,633
grant me the wisdom of all things.

3
00:00:08,766 --> 00:00:10,300
I call upon thee...

4
00:00:11,983 --> 00:00:14,216
The stripped {RUBY_B#Netherwing}dead dragon's{RUBY_E#} corpse —

5
00:00:24,233 --> 00:00:28,500
Rises from the earth, falls from the sky.

6
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:36,166
As above, so below...

7
00:00:39,116 --> 00:00:44,883
This is the greatest power of all powers, unstoppable in this world.

8
00:00:49,483 --> 00:00:52,283
The great work that commands all death,

9
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:57,566
I shall grant you embrace!
