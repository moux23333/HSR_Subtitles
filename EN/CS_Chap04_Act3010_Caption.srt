1
00:00:00,266 --> 00:00:05,233
We will now continue the journey and face our destiny.

2
00:00:06,033 --> 00:00:15,600
We will step over the gods' corpses and wander among humanity. And thus, we shall sweep apart Amphoreus' pitch-dark fog.

3
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:27,133
And at the end, all will reach that silver-white shoal, that end of the journey, that new world and new tomorrow.

4
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:36,466
It is a haven free from storms, cold, and heavy rains. No sorrow can linger there.

5
00:00:37,566 --> 00:00:42,766
We've made a promise to meet again at the end of the west wind, where flowers bloom in spring.

6
00:00:44,666 --> 00:00:46,766
See you tomorrow, Trianne.

7
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,100
Mmm. See you tomorrow!
