00:00:02,866 --> 00:00:11,200
Clockie's hands spin around non-stop, indicating confusion, frustration, and weakness.

2
00:00:12,133 --> 00:00:15,333
But ultimately, people still need to move forward,

3
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,766
just like your hands, always pointing ahead.

4
00:00:22,366 --> 00:00:27,400
This is where my journey ends. From now on...

5
00:00:28,266 --> 00:00:30,166
it is your path to walk.

6
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:33,333
"Trailblazing,"

7
00:00:34,366 --> 00:00:36,300
means taking paths your predecessors foreswore,

8
00:00:36,766 --> 00:00:38,233
and venturing even further...

9
00:00:41,233 --> 00:00:43,133
The Penacony in Mikhail's dreams,

10
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,233
does not belong to "Order."
