00:00:06,716 --> 00:00:16,100
Among them, countless belong to heroes, countless to the nameless, countless to geniuses, and countless to fools...

00:00:17,516 --> 00:00:22,566
But tonight belongs only to you, and no one can deprive you of it.

00:00:34,266 --> 00:00:38,266
It translates to "This night, nothing occurred."

00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:42,283
