00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,733
Hey, little miss, are you alright?

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:07,833
Pleasure to meet you. Who... might you be?

3
00:00:08,866 --> 00:00:18,633
Galaxy Ranger. I received a distress signal. This place really is the territory of Dr. Primitive's henchmen. It's as hard to find as those *Ninja Slang* bananas hidden in the woods.

4
00:00:19,833 --> 00:00:27,433
Ninja Hero? Huh. It seems my trial has finally come to an end.

5
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:35,000
Trial? What kind of *Ninja Slang*... Another poor kid driven mad by those monkeys, *Ninja Slang*.

6
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:44,400
The final trial of the Mappou Age... Destroy the matrix of Osaru's house and end the catastrophe.

7
00:00:45,566 --> 00:00:50,700
Pray tell... Have I proven myself worthy of the title of "Ninja Hero"?

8
00:00:51,933 --> 00:00:57,433
*Ninja Slang*, no way... So that's why all those *Ninja Slang* in the lab are lying dead on the ground.

9
00:00:58,033 --> 00:01:00,200
Was it all your doing?

10
00:01:00,766 --> 00:01:05,033
Ten years of suffering, one day of recognition...

11
00:01:05,966 --> 00:01:14,766
I have not let down Dazzling Ninjutsu... Master Kucha, I really wish you could witness this...

12
00:01:16,066 --> 00:01:25,600
*Ninja Slang*, I get it now. This girl's infected with a memetic virus. *Ninja Slang*, most people would've turned into complete *Ninja Slang* by now, but she's still running around like nothing's wrong?

13
00:01:26,233 --> 00:01:31,433
Please, listen to me! You're in serious danger right now. If you don't get treated soon, your brain will eventually burst!

14
00:01:31,433 --> 00:01:36,466
Wait! Since I am now a ninja hero who can contend with evil ninjas...

15
00:01:36,833 --> 00:01:39,466
Might I... lend you a hand?

16
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:43,200
*Ninja Slang*, you're asking me this now. Do you have a death wish?

17
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:51,233
You want to go on The Hunt? Know that this is a road of no return!

18
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:59,633
Great Lan above. Eradicating evil, till my last breath. My bow drawn, no turning back...

19
00:02:00,133 --> 00:02:03,366
...My heart shall remain unmoved.

20
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:09,433
Whoever follows the way of the ninja is a ninja. I...

21
00:02:09,733 --> 00:02:11,366
I've made my decision.
