1
00:00:00,766 --> 00:00:02,833
You've doomed yourselves...

2
00:00:06,933 --> 00:00:14,033
As I meet my demise, so shall the entire Xianzhou Luofu!

3
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:19,733
The "crimson moon" in my chest will make this place shine with blood!

4
00:00:20,866 --> 00:00:29,899
I will drive all foxians to madness in their fear... craving slaughter... without end!

5
00:00:32,466 --> 00:00:39,833
What now, Feixiao...?

6
00:00:40,299 --> 00:00:41,399
...What is this!?

7
00:00:41,899 --> 00:00:45,600
This is the "heart" of the Borisin Warhead, a product of the plaguemark.

8
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:50,066
I'll leave the next part to you.

9
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,766
General, I don't understand...

10
00:00:57,866 --> 00:01:03,200
We cannot allow this thing to spread. I will do all within my power to consume this "crimson moon."

11
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:10,866
Once the situation changes... Lieutenant Yanqing, you are to enforce the Cloud Knight's military rules. Understood?

12
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:30,166
General?
