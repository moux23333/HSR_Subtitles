1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:04,466
The Astral Express and the Stellaron Hunters... are like light and shadow.

2
00:00:05,433 --> 00:00:11,400
We walk on different paths, intertwined, moving forward and growing together...

3
00:00:12,533 --> 00:00:17,133
Maybe the end is predestined, but... it is not today.

4
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:19,966
Since things are going too well...

5
00:00:20,533 --> 00:00:22,566
Let's speed up the countdown!

6
00:00:23,633 --> 00:00:31,866
Human life is short, just like fyreflies to a flame. So, if you have an answer in your heart...

7
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:36,433
Always remember, don't leave with any regrets.

8
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,166
We have this right... don't we?

9
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,900
Since you care so much about other people's safety —

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,533
Why don't you go take a closer look!

11
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:17,233
You see, everything is possible in this land of dreams.

12
00:01:18,566 --> 00:01:23,666
We each came here with our own goals, and realized them in unimaginable ways.

13
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:36,100
Regardless if the result was a sweet illusion or a bitter reality, it was an answer we longed for day and night.

14
00:01:37,733 --> 00:01:45,833
So, why do people choose to slumber? I think it's as you said...

15
00:01:46,766 --> 00:01:50,533
Because in the end, we will wake up from our dreams.
