00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,500
Alright, it's time to leave the space station.

2
00:00:21,633 --> 00:00:26,616
Indeed, this is only a minor ripple that no one will ever notice...

3
00:00:28,666 --> 00:00:32,750
So, you must also understand, for a genius...

4
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:37,433
The importance of asking questions outweighs the importance of the answers themselves.

5
00:00:42,299 --> 00:00:45,166
So-called magic has its own set of principles

6
00:00:46,833 --> 00:00:49,283
There are no mysteries in this universe that cannot be solved.

7
00:00:51,683 --> 00:00:52,116
So...

8
00:01:00,299 --> 00:01:01,899
All-seeing presence—

9
00:01:03,783 --> 00:01:04,983
I ask you this—

10
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:09,283
What is divinity?
