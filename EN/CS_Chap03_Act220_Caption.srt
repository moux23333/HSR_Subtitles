00:00:05,716 --> 00:00:09,416
Always hide your ace with a straight face...

2
00:00:10,466 --> 00:00:12,550
I'm starting to get a bit impatient with you all.

3
00:00:20,716 --> 00:00:22,550
Friends, to fully relish this—

4
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,450
I'm betting every last chip!

5
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:31,150
Only by casting aside reason does one truly gamble...

6
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:44,516
"Emanator"— I know you'll match my wager.

7
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:45,666
Right?
