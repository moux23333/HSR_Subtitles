00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:06,066
Here —

2
00:00:06,733 --> 00:00:07,800
a genius move!

3
00:00:09,366 --> 00:00:10,633
And how will you counter it?

4
00:00:11,166 --> 00:00:13,966
*sigh* Only an idiot would ask such a question.

5
00:00:15,266 --> 00:00:16,200
Just move this here...

6
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,066
You look distressed.

7
00:00:30,433 --> 00:00:31,200
Something the matter?

8
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:36,566
If that's the case...

9
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:38,066
...you better get thinking.
